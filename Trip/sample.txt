//** i store FetchDataAi as string thats why the problem occur  


//** Why Hotels Are not redering ** //
Wrong Path for Hotels:

You were accessing parsedTripDataAI.travelPlan?.hotels, but hotels were actually at parsedTripDataAI.hotels.
Fix: const hotels = parsedTripDataAI.hotels || []

State Update Issue (setTrip)
Instead of setTrip({...tripData, hotels, travelPlan: parsedTripDataAI.travelPlan}), you should use a function inside setTrip().
Fix: setTrip((prev) => ({ ...prev, hotels, travelPlan: parsedTripDataAI.travelPlan }))
Why? Because setTrip({...tripData, hotels, ...}) was overwriting previous state instead of preserving it.

>>>>> Future Update <<<<<<<<<<<

I understand you want to know about implementing checkout functionality. For a hotel booking system, the checkout process typically involves:
Collecting user details
** Payment processing
** Booking confirmation
** Storing booking history
** Creates a booking record in Firestore
** Stores booking history for each user
** Clears the cart after successful booking
** Shows a confirmation page with booking details
** Handles errors appropriately

******* Note: This is a basic implementation. In a production environment, you would also want to:

** Add payment processing
** Implement booking validation
** Add email notifications
** Include cancellation functionality
** Add more detailed booking status tracking
** Implement proper error handling and recovery
** Add loading states and better UX
